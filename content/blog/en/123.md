Why would I create a blog? Honestly as I'm writing this article, I'm asking myself the same question...

# My first blog post

Welcome to my first blog post using \[content v2 module\](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
Hey there! 👋🏾
This is my first blog post learning nuxt content.
I'm currently building it using the following:

- Nuxt.js
- Nuxt Content module
- TailwindCSS
  - TailwindCSS typography

## Nuxt.js

\[Nuxt\](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a powerful Vue framework that offers excellent development features such as server-side rendering.

```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt-app
cd nuxt-app
yarn install
yarn dev -o
```
